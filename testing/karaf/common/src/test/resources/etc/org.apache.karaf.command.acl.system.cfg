#
# This configuration file defines the ACLs for commands in the system subshell
#
# The format of this file is as follows:
# The name of the file corresponds to a Configuration Admin PID. This file is for PID:
#    org.apache.karaf.command.acl.system
# The prefix org.apache.karaf.command.acl. determines that this file defines ACLs for karaf
# commands. The last word on the PID declares the scope that it applies to, i.e. this file
# is for the 'system' scope.
# Entries in this file map to commands within the defined scope. The simplest role definition
# has the form:
#   command = role1, role2, role3
# Specific roles can also be declared for certain arguments to the command. This is done using
# regular expression matching. 
# All the arguments to the command are represented as a list using the following syntax:
#   [arg1,arg2,arg3]
# The matching is done after converting this list into a string. So the line
#   start-level[/.*[0-9][0-9][0-9]+.*/] = manager
# declares that a manager role is needed to set a start level with 3 digits or more. The .* 
# wildcards at the beginning and end are used to match the '[' and ']' characters surrounding.
# When looking for a match the regular-expression based ACLs are always checked first. If any
# of them match the associated roles are used.
#
# If no match can be found based on reg-exp ACLs, a match is looked for based purely on the 
# command name. 
#
# If no command-name match can be found it is assumed that the command does not need a specific 
# role and can therefore be invoked by any user.

property = admin
shutdown = admin
start-level[/.*[0-9][0-9][0-9]+.*/] = manager # manager can set startlevels above 100
start-level[/[^0-9]*/] = viewer               # viewer can obtain the current start level
start-level = admin                           # admin can set any start level, including < 100
